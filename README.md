# Ensemble ALS Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using ensemble machine learning techniques. The model combines multiple classifiers to improve accuracy and robustness in ALS diagnosis.

## Features
- Implements ensemble learning techniques for ALS detection.
- Utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms for better performance.
- Works with a muscle strength dataset to train and evaluate the model.
- Provides insights into how ensemble methods enhance classification performance.

## Dataset
- **File:** `handmus - Copy.csv`
- **Description:** Contains muscle strength measurements of individuals, which serve as features for the classification task.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation & Usage

## Project Structure
- `Ensemble.pdf`: Documentation detailing the ensemble learning methodology used.
- `handmus - Copy.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `LICENSE`: Open-source license details.
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Model Implementation
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- Multiple classifiers are combined using ensemble techniques such as Bagging, Boosting, or Stacking.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model effectiveness.

## Results
- The ensemble model outperforms individual classifiers in terms of accuracy and reliability.
- Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves provide insights into model performance.

## Future Work
- Exploring deep learning approaches for ALS detection.
- Enhancing feature selection and data preprocessing techniques.
- Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
